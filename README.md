## Pitched
One can't deny that when it comes to healthcare technology here in the Philippines, there's still a lot left to be desired.

Sure, our doctors, nurses and other medical staff may be some of the best healthcare workers in the world, but they lack in resources and technological infrastructure that could possibly make their jobs easier. These hindrances could even affect the accuracy of their jobs and their effectivity as healthcare providers as a whole. 

Take medical technologists, for example. 

Based on gathered data, the average medical technologist spends years of training and experience before they can immediately detect and identify a microorganism called entamoeba histolytica from microscopic samples. This equates to a significant amount of man-hours and resources dedicated to just picking out this one microorganism from a slide. This also allows for a margin of error, which can lead to incorrect treatment regimen that could possibly do more harm than good to the patient.

That being said, we have developed an application that takes advantage of region based convolutional neural networks (RCNN) to detect entamoeba in microscopic slides. Imagine an app that can help medical technologists identify this protozoa in a matter of seconds. This technology can cut down patient costs and bridge the experience gap needed by medtechs in identifying this particular microorganism. It can also increase the sensitivity and specificity of microscopic examination without having to rely on advanced medical machines. It's a win-win solution for both patient and healthcare workers.

We aim to introduce artificial intelligence in the medical fieldâ€™s imaging processes through this application and hope that it can pave the way for the creation of other imaging applications to help elevate the Filipino healthcare system.

## Built with
* [Darkflow Model](https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow) - The prominent YOLO algorithm implmented in python
* [ElectronsJS](https://electronjs.org/) - Framework that empowers capability to project as desktop application
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - Framework build behind the darkflow model

## Testing/Deployment
The application have gone through few accuracy tests as of moment with guidance and help from Cebu Doctors Hospital Medical Laboratory and Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center. Comprising the evaluation process are the test for sensitivity and specificity.
